## Getting Started
Use these instructions to get the project up and running.

### Prerequisites
You will need the following tools:

* [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
* [.Net Core 8.0 or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)

### Installing
Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:
1. Clone the repository
2. At the root directory, restore required packages by running:
```csharp
dotnet restore
```
3. Next, build the solution by running:
```csharp
dotnet build
```
4. Next, within the AspnetRun.Web directory, launch the back end by running:
```csharp
dotnet run
```
5. Launch http://localhost:*YOURLOCALPORT*/ in your browser to view the Web UI.

If you have **Visual Studio** after cloning Open solution with your IDE, AspnetRun.Web should be the start-up project. Directly run this project on Visual Studio with **F5 or Ctrl+F5**. You will see index page of project, you can navigate product and category pages and you can perform crud operations on your browser.

### Usage
After cloning or downloading the sample you should be able to run it using an In Memory database immediately. The default configuration of Entity Framework Database is **"InMemoryDatabase"**.
If you wish to use the project with a persistent database, you will need to run its Entity Framework Core **migrations** before you will be able to run the app, and update the ConfigureDatabases method in **Startup.cs** (see below).

```csharp
public void ConfigureDatabases(IServiceCollection services)
{
            //// use in-memory database
            //services.AddDbContext<AspnetRunContext>(c =>
            //    c.UseInMemoryDatabase("AspnetRunConnection"));

            // add real database dependecy
            services.AddDbContext<AspnetRunContext>(c =>
                c.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("AspnetRunConnection")));  
}
```

1. Ensure your connection strings in ```appsettings.json``` point to a local SQL Server instance.

2. Open a command prompt in the Web folder and execute the following commands:

```csharp
dotnet restore
dotnet ef database update -c AspnetRunContext
```
Or you can direct call ef commands from Visual Studio **Package Manager Console**. Open Package Manager Console, set default project to AspnetRun.Infrastructure and run below command;
```csharp
update-database
```
These commands will create aspnetrun database which include Product and Category table. You can see from **AspnetRunContext.cs**.
1. Run the application.
The first time you run the application, it will seed aspnetrun sql server database with a few data such that you should see products and categories.

If you modify-change or add new some of entities to Core project, you should run ef migrate commands in order to update your database as the same way but below commands;
```csharp
add-migration YourCustomEntityChanges
update-database
```

### Structure of Project
**run-aspnetcore-basic** is a general purpose to implement the **Default Web Application template of .Net** with **one solution one project for fastest idea implementations** to building modern web applications with latest ASP.NET Core & EF Core technologies. 

Repository include folders for group implementations;
* Data
    * AspnetRunContext    
    * AspnetRunContextSeed    
* Entities
    * Product    
    * Category    
* Migrations
    * Generated by scaffolding from ef.core    
* Pages
    * Default Razor Web Application Template of Asp.Net Core
* Repositories
    * IProductRepository
    * ProductRepository
* wwwroot
* Startup.cs
* Program.cs
    
### Data Folder
Includes **Entity Framework Core Context** and tables in this folder. When new entity created, it should add to context and configure in context.
The Infrastructure project depends on Microsoft.**EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer** and EF.Core related nuget packages, you can check nuget packages of Infrastructure layer. If you want to change your data access layer, it can easily be replaced with a lighter-weight ORM like Dapper. 

#### Migrations
EF add-migration classes.
#### Repository
EF Repository implementation. This class responsible to create queries, includes, where conditions etc..

### Entities Folder
Includes Entity Framework Core Entities which creates sql table with **Entity Framework Core Code First Aproach**. Some Aggregate folders holds entity and aggregates.
You can see example of **code-first** Entity definition as below;

```csharp
public class Product
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }

        [Required, StringLength(80)]
        public string Name { get; set; }

        [Required, StringLength(255)]
        public string Description { get; set; }

        public int UnitPrice { get; set; }        

        public int CategoryId { get; set; }
        public Category Category { get; set; }
    }
```

### Repository Folder
Implementation of Core interfaces in this project with **Entity Framework Core** and other dependencies.
Most of your application's dependence on external resources should be implemented in classes defined in the Infrastructure project. These classes must implement the interfaces defined in Core. If you have a very large project with many dependencies, it may make sense to have more than one Infrastructure project (eg Infrastructure.Data), but in most projects one Infrastructure project that contains folders works well.
This could be includes, for example, **e-mail providers, file access, web api clients**, etc. For now this repository only dependend sample data access and basic domain actions, by this way there will be no direct links to your Core or UI projects.

```csharp
public interface IProductRepository
    {
        Task<IEnumerable<Product>> GetProductListAsync();
        Task<Product> GetProductByIdAsync(int id);
        Task<IEnumerable<Product>> GetProductByNameAsync(string name);
        Task<IEnumerable<Product>> GetProductByCategoryAsync(int categoryId);
        Task<Product> AddAsync(Product product);
        Task UpdateAsync(Product product);
        Task DeleteAsync(Product product);
        Task<IEnumerable<Category>> GetCategories();
    }
```
Also implementation located same places in order to choose different implementation at runtime when DI bootstrapped.
```csharp
 public class ProductRepository : IProductRepository
    {
        protected readonly AspnetRunContext _dbContext;

        public ProductRepository(AspnetRunContext dbContext)
        {
            _dbContext = dbContext ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(dbContext));
        }

        public async Task<IEnumerable<Product>> GetProductListAsync()
        {
            return await _dbContext.Products.ToListAsync();
        }

        public async Task<Product> GetProductByIdAsync(int id)
        {
            return await _dbContext.Products
                .Include(p => p.Category)
                .FirstOrDefaultAsync(p => p.Id == id);
        }
```


### Pages Folder
Development of UI Logic with implementation. Interfaces drives business requirements and implementations in this layer.
The application's main **starting point** is the ASP.NET Core web project. This is a classical console application, with a public static void Main method in Program.cs. It currently uses the default **ASP.NET Core project template** which based on **Razor Pages** templates. This includes appsettings.json file plus environment variables in order to stored configuration parameters, and is configured in Startup.cs.

#### Used Components
* Asp.Net Core
* Entity Framework Core
* Razor Pages
    * Scaffolding Razor
    * Tag Helpers
    * Bindings
    * Model Validations
    * Navigation - Page Routes
    * User Interfaces
    * Partial Views
    * View Components
    * Razor Sections
    * Dynamic Layout
* Middlewares
* Logging
* Configuration
* Dependency Injection

***Most of these features implemented on real-world repository of this repos.Check for real-world examples.

### wwwroot Folder
The wwwroot folder in the ASP.NET Core project is treated as a web root folder. Static files can be stored in any folder under the web root and accessed with a relative path to that root.

In the standard ASP.NET application, static files can be served from the root folder of an application or any other folder under it. This has been changed in ASP.NET Core. Now, only those files that are in the web root - wwwroot folder can be served over an http request. All other files are blocked and cannot be served by default.

### Program.cs
ASP.NET Core web application is actually a console project which starts executing from the entry point public static void Main() in Program class where we can create a host for the web application.

### Startup.cs
ASP.NET Core application must include Startup class. It is like Global.asax in the traditional .NET application. As the name suggests, it is executed first when the application starts.
